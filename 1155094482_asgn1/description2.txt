We need to preserve at least 113 dimensions to achieve POV larger than 0.95.
The original dimensions is 784 (each pixel). 
However some dimensions have less variance (e.g. The pixel in top left corner. It is always black in all images). 
We can reduce those dimensions and still get relative important features.
We can calculate POV to determine how much dimensions we need to preserve.
POV = sum of top n highest eigenvalues / sum of all eigenvalues
Then we can convert the image with 784 dimensions to 113 dimensions by X * V,
where X is matrix 1500 * 784, each row is an image
and V is matrix 784 * 113, each column is an eigenvector.
